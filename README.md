# MediQL

# Description
MediQL is a GraphQL developer tool, built to work on top of GraphiQL, an open-source web-based integrated development environment (IDE). MediQL takes it a step further by delivering query response visualization, error indication, and the ability to observe original external API response objects which GraphiQL can not.
